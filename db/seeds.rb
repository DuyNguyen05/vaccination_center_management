# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# 10.times do |n|
#   company_code = "#{n+1} code"
#   name = Faker::Company.name
#   address = Faker::Company.industry

#   Company.create(company_code: company_code, name: name, address: address)
# end

# 30.times do |n|
#   code = Faker::Code.imei
#   name = Faker::Beer.name
#   manufacture = Faker::Beer.brand
#   expiry_date = Faker::Date.between(from: Date.today, to: 1.year.from_now)
#   content = Faker::Marketing.buzzwords
#   inventory = Faker::Number.within(range: 1..50)

#   Vaccine.create!(
#     code: code, name: name, manufacture: manufacture, expiry_date: expiry_date, content: content, inventory: inventory
#   )
